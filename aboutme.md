My name is Chris Tusciuk.
I have many years of progressive web development and IT strategy experience, in a diverse set of industries: IT Consulting, Telecommunications, Marketing, and Non-profit. 

I specialize in helping non-profit cultural organizations define and reach attainable technology goals to increase engagement with your audience, and improve the productivity of your staff.

### my path to here

I started my career in the for-profit world as a software developer and IT analyst, and while I enjoyed the technology, working without a mission left me wanting more from my career. I moved to New York, hoping for an inspirational opportunity, and found the arts. A lifelong appreciator of music & film, I found an opportunity to use my technical knowledge to lead multiple website redesigns for [BAM](http://www.bam.org) (Brooklyn Academy of Music), and later to serve as the Director of IT for [The New 42nd Street](http://new42.org). Through these roles, I saw many other organizations that needed a hand with technology from time to time, and made the decision to consult. This has allowed me to help many understand and believe that mission-based organization deserve, and can achieve, high levels of technology offerings. Technology does more than supports your mission. It reflects it. I'm here to help.
