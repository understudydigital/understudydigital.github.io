title: Launching a site
---

After a year plus of consulting, I decided it was time to launch a site to reference my work. Using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I've built this site as an example of a simple, static site, based on the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme by Dean Attali. Thanks, Dean!
